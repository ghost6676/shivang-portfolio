        I am Shivang, a product designer passionate about creating products that
        are functional and beautiful. <br />
        <br />
        I&#39;m currently pursuing my Bachelors in the field of Information
        Technology. I&#39;ve always been a keen admirer of visually beautiful
        stuff so I started graphic design in the first year of my college. I
        freelanced for about a year as a graphic designer. Soon, I shifted to UX
        Design as the field appealed to me as a perfect blend of visual design
        and technology.
        <br />
        <br />I was able to leverage a lot of skills and design principles I had
        picked up from graphic design to expedite my journey of self-learning UX
        Design. I loved solving problems by making stuff and paying meticulous
        attention to small details. <br />
        <br />
        When I&#39;m not designing, you&#39;ll find me playing chess, watching
        anime or reading fantasy novels.
